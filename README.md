*	This is a table from [survey](abe/基于属性的加密算法.pdf) for development of abe from none(2005) to 2011![history](abe/history.png)

* [This](abe/Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption) denotes the birth of abe

* [This](abe/Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption) denotes a millstone of abe



According to day 4/4's discussion, we should research abe-signcryption, thus [a](abe/Pandit2014_Chapter_Attribute-BasedSigncryptionSig) and [b](Threshold Attribute-Based Signcryption in Standard Model) are recommended.
